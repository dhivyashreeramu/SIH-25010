## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

The Smart Crop Advisory System functions like a digital farm assistant for small and marginal farmers, combining AI-powered intelligence with real-time data. At its core, an AI/ML engine analyzes inputs like soil data, weather forecasts, crop history, and market trends to provide personalized, timely crop recommendations. Data is collected through satellite imagery, weather APIs, farmer inputs, and optional IoT sensors. The system is accessible via a simple, multilingual mobile app (or SMS/IVR for feature phones), supporting low-literacy and offline users. Cloud infrastructure ensures secure data storage, while real-time alerts guide farmers through sowing, irrigation, pest control, and harvesting. Modular and scalable, the system also integrates with government schemes, market platforms, and FPOs — creating an end-to-end smart farming ecosystem.
## Feasibility and Viability

The Smart Crop Advisory System is both technically feasible and economically viable, particularly in the context of small and marginal farmers in developing regions. On the feasibility front, the solution leverages existing infrastructure such as mobile networks, soil health databases, satellite imagery, and weather APIs. Its mobile-first design ensures accessibility even in rural areas, with offline functionality and support for SMS/IVR catering to feature phone users. The use of AI/ML models is practical and scalable, thanks to open-source frameworks and affordable cloud infrastructure. Pilot testing can begin in a single agro-climatic zone with limited resources and scale incrementally.

In terms of viability, the system has strong potential for sustainability through partnerships with government agencies, agri-tech companies, NGOs, and farmer producer organizations (FPOs). Monetization models — such as subscription-based premium features, B2B licensing for agri-input companies, or integration with crop insurance providers — offer financial sustainability. Most importantly, the system addresses core pain points: low yields, climate risks, input misuse, and market inaccessibility. This ensures high adoption potential and measurable impact, making it a strong candidate for long-term success and scalability across regions.
